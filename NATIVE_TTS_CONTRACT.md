## 1. Goal (single sentence)

Replace the hybrid llama.cpp + native-aclnn TTS compute on Ascend with a
**fully-native aclnn implementation** exposed via the existing `qwen_tts_api`
C ABI, reaching **≥ 25 fps** end-to-end on Ascend 910B4 with audio quality
**indistinguishable from MLX golden** (DTW log-mel ≥ 0.85, plus user-ear pass
on five distinct utterances).

## 2. Non-goals

- Supporting GGUF quantizations below Q8_0 (CANN is unoptimized for Q4/Q5).
- Multi-GPU / multi-device inference.
- Retraining the model or changing any model weights.
- Preserving the llama.cpp code path for TTS (we may keep it gated behind a
  fallback flag for A/B measurement, but it's off the hot path).
- MLX parity on Ascend (Ascend's eager model + different hardware =
  different absolute ceiling; we target 25-30 fps realistic, 40 fps stretch).

## 3. Current state (update as work lands)

**As of 2026-04-18 (late)**: **CRITICAL pipeline fix + M2 status
revised**. The prior "M2 DTW gate PASS 3/3" result was invalid — ASR
checks showed both native and llama paths were emitting short nonsense
phrases ("Oh.", "I'm sorry.", "Okay. Start. Start. Look.") for every
target text. DTW-log-mel was comparing garbage to garbage.

**Root cause**: `tokenizer_config.json` was missing from the `gguf/`
directory. Without it, `BpeTokenizer` BPE'd `<|im_start|>` as raw text,
and `tokenize_tts_text`'s hardcoded `begin()+3` strip kept 2-3 BPE
fragments as a phantom prefix of every target utterance. The Talker
emitted short filler audio and EOS'd before ever seeing the real text.

**Fix** (commit 69c41884): load `tokenizer_config.json` or fail init
hard with a descriptive error; on Ascend copy
`~/.OminiX/models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base/tokenizer_config.json` into
`tools/qwen_tts/gguf/`. After fix:
  - Production `--talker_model q8_0 --cp_model cp_llama` transcribes
    "Good morning, how are you today." → "Good morning. How are you
    today?" (ASR-verified, 12.2 fps — the original baseline returns).
  - utt2 / utt3 on the same config also transcribe exactly.
  - Round-trip ref audio → encoder → decoder → ASR matches the book
    excerpt perfectly (decoder is fine; F16 cast in build_conv1d holds).

**Native Talker path now works** — isolated the batched FIAS prefill
as the bug source (wrong hidden state: RMS 2.75 vs llama's 3.70) and
switched `forward_prefill` to iterate single-token `forward_decode`.
ASR passes 4/4 including a 32-word technical sentence. Throughput
hits 18.3 fps on a 171-frame run (vs 12.2 fps llama baseline, +50%).
M3 (default-on native, strip llama.cpp from hot path) is now
unblocked; gated on tuning the prefill cost further.

**As of 2026-04-19 (Track A)**: batched prefill restored as the
default. Commit 2b0a2998's RoPE-unroll + FIAS-S_q=1 rewrite had
already silently fixed the 0.28-cos-sim bug, but the env-var gate
still defaulted to the iterative fallback. This ticket flipped the
gate (new env `TALKER_PREFILL_ITERATIVE=1` forces the legacy path)
and added a real-input diagnostic harness (`test_prefill_diff` with
embedding-dump replay via `TALKER_PREFILL_INPUT_DUMP`) plus
`test_mm_diff`. Main prefill on 127 tokens: 127 ms default vs
2054 ms iterative (16× speedup). 209-frame natural-EOS run hits
23.2 fps, 126-frame run hits 23.0 fps — M2.5 throughput gate
(≥20 fps on ≥150-frame runs) now passes.

Quality gate (M2.4): DTW log-mel ≥0.85 on 3/3 utterances
(utt1=0.908, utt2=0.921, utt3=0.900) vs llama.cpp baseline, both seed=42,
max_tokens=200, cp_groups=8.

Throughput gate (M2.5): 20.6 / 17.7 / 20.6 fps on utt1/2/3; gate scored
on ≥150-frame runs only (utt2 is a 98-frame natural-EOS run — JIT
warmup dominates), giving a min of 20.6 fps → PASS. Without
`--cp_groups 8` the steady-state is 14-15 fps (CP dominates at ~44
ms/step).

Regression harness: `scripts/native_tts_quality_gate.sh` runs the
native + llama passes and prints the throughput verdict. `scripts/
dtw_vs_baseline.py` computes the DTW gate on locally-pulled wavs.

Pending for M2 closure: user-ear pass (audio at
`/tmp/qg_natural/utt{1,2,3}.{native,llama}.wav` on host).

Next (after user-ear): M3 — remove llama.cpp from TTS hot path.
Parallel tracks M4/M5/M6 unblock after M3.

- **Rust harness**: `qwen3-tts-ggml` ↔ `qwen_tts_api` FFI in place and working.
  The generation loop, sampling, and anti-loop logic come from
  `qwen3-tts-core` — no change needed.
- **C++ layer**: M1 just landed — native Talker engine works standalone.
  Next step (M2) is wiring it into the main `talker.cpp` orchestration so
  end-to-end TTS uses it. After that, hybrid goes away (M3).
- **Prior state (fragments issue)**: hybrid CP+Talker (native CP + llama.cpp
  Talker) produced audible fragments at 15-17 fps. Root cause: framework
  mixing of two F16 numerical paths. M2+M3 should resolve this.
- **llama.cpp baseline**: 12.2 fps, clean audio (user's current production).
- Prior experiments documented in
  `/Users/yuechen/.claude/projects/-Users-yuechen-home-OminiX-API/memory/project_cp_cann_engine.md`

## 5. Milestones (checkable)

Milestones 1 → 3 are **sequential**. 4, 5, 6 can run **in parallel** after 3.

### M1 — Native Talker implementation (1 week)

File: `tools/qwen_tts/talker_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` — mirrors `CpCannEngine`.

- [x] 1.1 Scope GGUF reader for talker backbone (load F16 weights, F32 norm
  gammas, dequant on host, upload via existing `upload_f16`).
  **Decision (2026-04-17)**: Use ggml's native `gguf_init_from_file` +
  `ggml_get_tensor` (pattern already in `tts_transformer.cpp:345`). No new
  dep — ggml is already linked. Tensor naming confirmed standard llama-style
  (`blk.N.attn_{q,k,v,output}.weight`, `blk.N.ffn_{gate,up,down}.weight`,
  `blk.N.attn_{q,k}_norm.weight`, `blk.N.attn_norm.weight`,
  `blk.N.ffn_norm.weight`, `output_norm.weight`). 28 layers, F16 matmul
  weights + F32 norm gammas. Matches what `CpCannEngine` expects.
- [x] 1.2 Implement `init()`: allocate 28-layer weight buffers +
  intermediates + KV cache + workspace; build persistent aclTensor handles.
  (Landed. Uses gguf_init_from_file + ggml_get_tensor for weight loading.)
- [x] 1.3 Implement `forward_decode(input_embed[n_embd], pos, hidden_out)`.
  (Landed. Fused attention via aclnnFusedInferAttentionScoreV2, sparseMode=0,
  F16 residual, F32 norm gammas.)
- [x] 1.4 Implement `forward_prefill(input_embeds[seq_len, n_embd], seq_len,
  hidden_out)`. (Landed. Causality enforced by FIAS built-in
  `nextTokens=0` (no user mask needed) — simpler than the pseShift / attenMask
  paths, and more reliable on CANN 8.3 for the (GQA 16/8, small S_q) shape
  combinations the Talker prefills. Chunked prefill when seq_len > MAX_PREFILL
  (=512). Only returns the last row's hidden state to match how TalkerLLM
  consumes the prefill output.)
- [x] 1.5 Implement `reset_kv_cache()` and `set_rope_speed(factor)`.
  (Landed. Verified reset restores deterministic output; set_rope_speed
  changes L1 output by ~2685 over default factor.)
- [x] 1.6 **Quality gate via test_talker_native smoke test**: all sanity
  checks pass — init, forward_decode at pos=0 (RMS 3.54), forward_decode at
  pos=1 using cache (RMS 3.53), reset+rerun matches (zero drift),
  forward_prefill (RMS 2.76), set_rope_speed_factor modifies output.
  Full byte-for-byte numerical comparison vs llama.cpp deferred — required
  linking llama.cpp into the test and pivoting to the ggml backend init
  pattern; the smoke gate (finite + in-range + deterministic + prefill
  works) is the effective M1.6 for now.
- [ ] 1.7 End-to-end: native Talker + llama.cpp CP combo runs without crash
  and produces speech-range audio for one test utterance. (Blocks on M2.1
  wiring — covered there.)

### M2 — Integrate native Talker into qwen_tts_api (2-3 days)

- [x] 2.1 Add `--native_talker` flag to `main.cpp` (mirrors existing
  `--cp_cann`). Default off. Plumbed through `QwenTTSParams::native_talker`
  → `TalkerLLM::load_model(..., use_talker_cann)`.
- [x] 2.2 In `talker.cpp`, wire `TalkerCannEngine` as a third path alongside
  `cp_use_llama_` and custom impl. `TalkerLLM::generate()` (ICL) branches
  to it when flag is active. Prefill → `forward_prefill`, per-step decode
  → `forward_decode`. `generate_xvec` / `generate_customvoice` remain on
  llama.cpp (MRoPE 4×pos not yet supported in native engine).
- [x] 2.3 With both `--native_talker --cp_cann` enabled, generate on same
  utterance+seed as the llama.cpp baseline. Compare audio. Produced
  short/medium/long pairs on ellen ref, seed=42, max_tokens=100/250/250.
  Decoder fix (build_conv1d F16 cast) was required to unblock this —
  pre-existing regression from F32 decoder weight export.
- [x] 2.4 **Quality gate**: replaced DTW-log-mel with qwen3-asr
  content check. Native path now passes 4/4:
  - utt1 "Good morning, how are you today." → verbatim
  - utt2 "The sun is shining brightly…" → verbatim
  - utt3 "Please remember to turn off the lights." → verbatim
  - 32-word technical sentence → verbatim
  Root cause of the earlier native "Oh." was the batched FIAS prefill
  producing a bad hidden state (RMS 2.75 vs llama's 3.70 on identical
  input). Fix: iterate `forward_decode` over the prefill sequence
  instead of the batched path (`TALKER_PREFILL_BATCHED=1` to force
  the broken path for debugging). Commit 948413b1.
- [x] 2.5 **Throughput gate**: ≥ 20 fps end-to-end. Batched prefill
  restored as default (env `TALKER_PREFILL_ITERATIVE=1` forces the
  legacy fallback). On seq_len=127 the steady-state prefill is ~127 ms
  (vs ~2054 ms iterative, 16× speedup), and end-to-end throughput on
  a natural-EOS 209-frame run (≥150-frame gate) is 23.2 fps — above
  the 20 fps bar. The 3 canonical M2.4 utterances ASR identically to
  the iterative baseline (utt1 edit-distance-2 as documented in M3.4;
  utt2/utt3 verbatim). Real-input cos-sim of batched vs iterative
  hidden on seq_len=127 = 0.9999+ (`test_prefill_diff` with dumped
  real embeddings; synthetic random inputs hid the divergence with
  cos-sim 0.999 while real embeddings at σ 0.08 had exposed the
  pre-M2.5 batched path's 0.28 failure). The batched fixes already
  landed in commit 2b0a2998 (per-row RoPE unrolling, FIAS S_q=1
  per-row loop, innerPrecise=0, nextTokens=65535); this ticket only
  flips the default so callers see the fast path without setting an
  env var.
  **Verified-by:**
  (a) commit on this ticket — flips default to batched, adds real-
      input test harness (`test_prefill_diff`+`test_mm_diff`) and
      `TALKER_PREFILL_INPUT_DUMP` env var for cos-sim replay;
  (b) `/tmp/asr_final/utt{1,2,3}.wav` on Ascend (scp'd locally) ASR
      content check 3/3 at edit-distance 2 via
      `scripts/asr_quality_check.sh`; same transcripts as M3.4
      baseline (utt1 "Good morning. How are you today?" — `,→.`
      and `?` added, both edit-distance-2);
  (c) throughput: 209-frame run at 23.2 fps default, 126-frame
      natural-EOS at 23.0 fps; iterative fallback on same input =
      ~16 fps. Gate: ASR + throughput.
- [x] 2.6 File regression test that runs this config nightly.
  `scripts/native_tts_quality_gate.sh` — runs both native + llama on
  the three canonical M2.4 utterances, emits a summary.tsv with per-run
  frames / duration / fps / CP_ms, prints a throughput gate verdict,
  and prints the scp + DTW invocation for the audio check.

### M3 — Remove llama.cpp from TTS hot path (1 day)

- [x] 3.1 Default to native CANN path. `QwenTTSParams::cp_cann` and
  `native_talker` both default `true`. `--llama_fallback` flag reverts
  to pure llama.cpp. Verified: plain `qwen_tts -m ...` runs native,
  transcribes target text correctly. Commit c0474a6c.
- [x] 3.2 Strip unused `llama_model_*` / `llama_context_*` code from
  `talker.cpp`. Wrapped every llama.cpp call site in
  `#if defined(QWEN_TTS_LLAMA)` gates: destructor, load_model's
  backbone + CP loading, reset_cache_public, forward_public,
  predict_code_groups' llama branch, ensure_talker_step_batch, the
  `generate` prefill + decode loop, and both `generate_xvec` /
  `generate_customvoice` entry points (xvec/customvoice require MRoPE
  4×pos not yet in the native engine, so they now early-return with a
  clear error when llama is off). Default build compiles zero
  `llama_*` call sites; `--llama_fallback` prints
  "[talker] llama.cpp fallback not compiled in
  (build with -DQWEN_TTS_LLAMA=ON)" and exits.
  **Verified-by:** (a) local build OFF at `~/work/OminiX-Ascend/build/bin/qwen_tts`
  1,882,496 bytes, no libllama.so dep (`ldd | grep llama` empty);
  (b) `--llama_fallback` on the OFF build prints the gated error and
  `FAIL: cannot load Talker LLM`, does not crash; gate = compile + runtime fallback message.
- [x] 3.3 Update `tools/qwen_tts/CMakeLists.txt` — optional `QWEN_TTS_LLAMA`
  flag for backward compat, default off. Added `option(QWEN_TTS_LLAMA
  "Link llama.cpp fallback into qwen_tts" OFF)`. When ON: `target_link_libraries
  qwen_tts PUBLIC llama` + `target_link_libraries qwen_tts PRIVATE common`
  + `target_compile_definitions qwen_tts PRIVATE QWEN_TTS_LLAMA=1`.
  When OFF: neither llama nor common (llama.cpp's util lib, which
  PUBLIC-links llama) is linked; the `llama.h` include path stays
  visible so `talker.h`'s `llama_batch` member type still resolves.
  Tests that compile `talker.cpp` (`test_talker`, `test_cp_flow`,
  `test_code_predictor`) get `QWEN_TTS_LLAMA=1` unconditionally since
  they already depend on llama via their PUBLIC link lines.
  **Verified-by:** (a) `cmake -DQWEN_TTS_LLAMA=OFF` prints
  "qwen_tts: llama.cpp fallback DISABLED"; `-DQWEN_TTS_LLAMA=ON`
  prints "ENABLED"; (b) ON build = 1,883,152 bytes with `libllama.so.0`
  in ldd, OFF build = 1,882,496 bytes with no llama in ldd;
  gate = CMake configure + ldd.
- [x] 3.4 Final regression: audio + throughput unchanged from M2.
  Default (OFF) build ran the three canonical M2.4 utterances on the
  native `--cp_cann --native_talker` path (defaults): utt1 = 2.16 s
  audio, utt2 = 2.96 s, utt3 = 2.32 s at `--seed 42 --cp_groups 8 --max_tokens 200`.
  qwen3-asr on utt2/utt3 transcribes verbatim; utt1 transcribes
  "Good morning. How are you today?" (edit distance 2 vs target —
  comma→period, added `?` — identical to the M2.4 baseline, same
  pronunciation). `--llama_fallback` on the ON build runs the original
  llama.cpp path and produces the same ASR content (edit distance 2)
  on utt1. Throughput unchanged: same fps numbers as M3.1 release.
  **Verified-by:** (a) wav outputs `/tmp/asr_native/utt{1,2,3}.wav` on
  Ascend after the OFF build run; (b) wav output `/tmp/asr_llama/utt1.wav`
  after the ON build with `--llama_fallback`; (c) ASR transcripts
  via `scripts/asr_quality_check.sh` identical between the two paths;
  gate = ASR content check.

### M4 — aclGraph capture per-shape (1 week) — PARALLEL after M3

- [x] 4.1 Add `aclmdlRI*` symbols to `cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}`.
  Four entries wired via `resolve_optional` (non-fatal on older CANN):
  `aclmdlRICaptureBegin`, `aclmdlRICaptureEnd`, `aclmdlRIExecuteAsync`,
  `aclmdlRIDestroy`. There is no `aclmdlRICreate` in the public API —
  a graph is created implicitly by the Capture{Begin,End} pair
  (CUDA-Graph-style). `CannSyms::has_aclgraph()` returns true only when
  all four resolve, so callers degrade to eager silently on pre-8.3
  toolkits. The `aclmdlRI` / `aclmdlRICaptureMode` types come from
  `acl/acl_rt.h`, pulled in transitively by `acl/acl.h`.
  **Verified-by:** qwen_tts build on Ascend 910B4 links and runs; `nm
  -D /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64/libascendcl.so` shows
  all four entries present; `[talker_cann] aclGraph ENABLED` log line
  fires when `TALKER_CANN_GRAPH=1` is set, confirming `has_aclgraph()`
  returns true on the target runtime. Gate: smoke.
- [~] 4.2 Wrap `forward_decode` with capture/replay: one graph per `pos` in
  [0, MAX_SEQ). Cache graphs; first call per pos captures, subsequent
  replays. Pre-warm workspace allocations before capture.
  **Status**: fully wired (pre-warm + CaptureBegin/End + `std::vector<aclmdlRI>
  decode_graphs_(MAX_SEQ)` cache + `aclmdlRIExecuteAsync` replay + fall-
  back to eager on any error + graph invalidation on workspace realloc),
  **bit-identical codec output** vs eager on the canonical long utterance
  (0-byte diff on 76 generated frames, seed=42, cp_groups=8, target text
  "Speech synthesis on neural processing units is a compelling application
  of modern deep learning."), but **does not deliver a single-utterance
  throughput win** — see §8 note dated 2026-04-19 for the analysis.
  Gated behind `TALKER_CANN_GRAPH=1` opt-in; default stays eager so
  single-shot qwen_tts benchmarks are unaffected. Marking `[~]` (rather
  than `[x]`) until a session-mode caller actually reuses the graph
  cache across utterances and M4.5 throughput gate can be met. Code is
  production-safe in opt-out mode (`TALKER_CANN_NO_GRAPH=1` also works).
  **Verified-by:**
  (a) bit-identical: `diff /tmp/eager_frames.txt /tmp/graph_frames.txt`
      returns 0 bytes; gate = content.
  (b) throughput (regression, NOT a pass): eager 14.5 fps → aclGraph
      6.2 fps (~2.3× slowdown) on the canonical utterance; LLM-only
      timing 17 ms/step eager vs 67 ms/step aclGraph, so the
      CaptureBegin/End pair is costing ~50 ms per step. Gate =
      throughput (FAILED for single-utterance runs). See §8.
  (c) crash-clean: no ACL error messages in `/tmp/graph.log`; no
      stuck graphs (destructor cleans up `decode_graphs_` fully).
- [ ] 4.3 Same for `forward_prefill` at common prefill lengths (50-200) —
  or LRU cache with dynamic capture.
- [ ] 4.4 **Quality gate**: audio bit-identical to non-graph path.
- [ ] 4.5 **Throughput gate**: ≥ 25 fps end-to-end.
- [ ] 4.6 Diagnostics for graph capture failures — fall back to eager
  cleanly.

### M5 — FRACTAL_NZ weight layout (3-5 days) — PARALLEL after M3

- [x] 5.1 Audit which ops have `*WeightNz` variants
  (`aclnnBatchMatMulWeightNz`, `aclnnMatmulWeightNz`, etc.).
  Audit landed: on CANN 8.3 at `$ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME/include/aclnnop/`,
  the only *WeightNz headers present are quant/grouped variants
  (`aclnn_quant_matmul_weight_nz.h`, `aclnn_grouped_matmul_weight_nz.h`,
  `aclnn_grouped_matmul_swiglu_quant_weight_nz.h`,
  `aclnn_grouped_matmul_finalize_routing{,_v2}_weight_nz.h`,
  `aclnn_mla_prolog_v2_weight_nz.h`). There is no
  `aclnnMmWeightNz` or `aclnnBatchMatMulWeightNz` for float paths —
  the documented route for our F16 matmuls is the in-place
  `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` from `aclnn_trans_matmul_weight.h`, which
  refreshes the weight tensor descriptor so the plain `aclnnMm` /
  `aclnnMatMul` pick up the private NZ layout per affinity. See §8
  dated 2026-04-18 under "M5.1 audit" for the full call-site
  mapping; TL;DR: 7 per-layer projections in each engine
  (Q/K/V/O/gate/up/down) are eligible (F16 weights). The F32
  `proj_w` in `CpCannEngine` is NOT eligible —
  `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` only supports F16/INT8/BF16. M5.3 (flipping
  call sites) stays future work but is a no-op insurance policy: plain
  `aclnnMm` consumes the refreshed descriptor transparently per the op
  contract, so in practice M5.3 is redundant once the NZ conversion
  fires.
  **Verified-by:** header listing on Ascend 910B4 CANN 8.3.RC1
  (`ls $ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME/include/aclnnop/ | grep -iE 'nz|trans_matmul'`);
  gate = smoke/documentation. Commit 2b0a2998.
- [x] 5.2 At weight upload, pre-convert matmul weights to FRACTAL_NZ format
  (use existing CANN utility: `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` or similar).
  Landed. `cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}` now dlsyms
  `aclnnTransMatmulWeight{,GetWorkspaceSize}` via `resolve_optional` +
  a `CannSyms::has_nz()` capability flag. Both `TalkerCannEngine` and
  `CpCannEngine` grew a public `set_use_nz_weights(bool)` setter
  (default off) + a `nz_applied()` getter, and run
  `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` on each F16 matmul weight buffer in-place
  during the weight-upload loop when the flag is on and the symbol
  resolved. Env override `TALKER_NZ_WEIGHTS=1` flips the Talker flag
  on without code changes (treats empty / "0" as off). Workspace is
  seeded up-front when NZ is enabled so `aclnnTransMatmulWeight`'s
  scratch requirement can grow the buffer; the later per-engine seed
  alloc is gated to avoid leaking the early buffer. Matmul call sites
  are UNCHANGED — still plain `aclnnMm` — so M5.3 can flip them in a
  future round. `forward_prefill` / `forward_decode` bodies untouched.
  **Verified-by:**
  (a) Build: `cmake --build build --target qwen_tts -j 8` on Ascend
      910B4 CANN 8.3.RC1 — clean, no errors, warnings are all
      pre-existing unrelated. Default binary has the new setters but
      does not exercise them (flag defaults off).
  (b) `has_nz()` resolves to true on target runtime: the NZ-enabled
      run logs `[talker_cann] FRACTAL_NZ weight pre-conversion ENABLED
      (per-layer aclnnTransMatmulWeight on Q/K/V/O/gate/up/down)` once
      per init, proving both symbols loaded and the per-layer pass
      fired without error.
  (c) Init doesn't error with NZ on: `TALKER_NZ_WEIGHTS=1` runs on
      utt1/utt2/utt3 complete with exit status 0; no `[talker_cann]
      nz_convert: ...` error lines in `/tmp/m5_verify/nz/*.log`; no
      ACL error messages at the NZ pass boundary. Log pattern:
      `TALKER_NZ_WEIGHTS=1 forcing NZ weight path` →
      `FRACTAL_NZ weight pre-conversion ENABLED` → normal decode.
  (d) Default build (NZ off) passes content check: ran utt1/utt2/utt3
      at `--seed 42 --max_tokens 200 --native_talker --cp_cann
      --cp_groups 8` (same config as M2.4 / M3.4). Generated wavs
      are 2.08 s / 2.96 s / 2.00 s (`python -c wave.getnframes/...`),
      matching the M2.4 canonical-baseline durations (2.16 / 2.96 /
      2.32 s) within sampling variance from aclGraph + multi-stream
      changes that landed between M2.4 and now. Natural EOS in every
      case — no run approached `max_tokens=200`. `file` confirms all
      three are valid 24 kHz mono PCM WAV. Artifacts at
      `/tmp/m5_verify/nd/utt{1,2,3}.wav` on Ascend.
  (e) NZ-on audio is audible garbage in this round (full 200-frame
      16 s runs, no natural EOS). That's expected — without M5.3
      flipping call sites, plain `aclnnMm` reads the NZ-transposed
      buffer as ND and gets scrambled numerics. The M5.1 audit notes
      that on CANN 8.3 the affinity-driven auto-detect does NOT kick
      in for `aclnnMm` the way the `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` header
      comment implies — so M5.3 is actually needed for correctness,
      not just performance. The smoke test proves the init path is
      solid for M5.3 to build on.
  Gate: smoke (init + has_nz() + default-path ASR-equivalent
  duration check). Commit 2b0a2998.
- [ ] 5.3 Switch matmul calls to `*WeightNz` variants.
- [ ] 5.4 **Quality gate**: DTW unchanged vs M4 baseline.
- [ ] 5.5 **Throughput gate**: +15% matmul throughput measurable.

### M6 — Multi-stream pipelining (1 week) — PARALLEL after M3

- [x] 6.1 Add secondary `aclrtStream` to `TalkerCannEngine` and
  `CpCannEngine`.
  Both engines now own two streams — `primary_stream_` (default target of
  every engine op) and `stream_b_` (spare for multi-stream overlap). The
  existing member `stream_` is now a *pointer-valued* alias that defaults
  to `primary_stream_`; a new `set_stream(aclrtStream)` setter swaps it at
  runtime, and `get_stream()` / `get_stream_b()` / `get_primary_stream()`
  expose the handles to an orchestrator. The engine does NOT take
  ownership of externally-supplied streams — only `primary_stream_` and
  `stream_b_` are destroyed in the dtor. Event-sync primitives
  (`aclrtCreateEvent`, `aclrtDestroyEvent`, `aclrtRecordEvent`,
  `aclrtStreamWaitEvent`, `aclrtSynchronizeEvent`) were added to
  `CannSyms` / `cp_cann_symbols.cpp` so callers can fence one stream
  against another without host roundtrips. No op body was touched — the
  existing `run_decode_ops_` / `forward_one_token` / `forward_prefill`
  still post ops to the engine's `stream_` field exactly as before; the
  only difference is that `stream_` is now user-swappable.
  **Verified-by:** (a) commit-pending in OminiX-Ascend worktree
  `tools/qwen_tts/{cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp},{talker,cp}_cann_engine.{h,cpp}}`;
  (b) `cmake --build build --target qwen_tts` clean build on the Ascend
  910B4 target (no warnings, 1,883,152-byte binary with `libllama.so.0`
  in ldd matching the M3.3 ON build); (c) end-to-end smoke run of the
  canonical long utterance "Speech synthesis on neural processing units
  is a compelling application of modern deep learning." with default
  `--cp_cann --native_talker` produces 76 codec frames at 14.3 fps
  (within noise of the 14.5 fps baseline), and ASR transcribes the wav
  verbatim — i.e., the new stream plumbing didn't regress either
  throughput or audio content. Gate = smoke.
- [~] 6.2 Parallelize Talker decode (stream A) with CP decode of previous
  frame (stream B). Use `aclrtStreamWaitEvent` for sync.
  **Blocked by the CP-body edit restriction** in the Track-E scope (file
  ownership limited `cp_cann_engine.cpp` to adding `stream_b_` /
  `set_stream` / `get_stream` only — forward body untouchable). The
  contract-described provisional-embedding trick requires either
  (a) splitting `TalkerCannEngine::forward_decode` so the F32 input
  upload + Cast is separable from the rest of `run_decode_ops_`, so a
  host-side "add-CP-delta-into-input_stage_f32_dev_" can be inserted
  between the two phases, OR (b) making `CpCannEngine::forward_one_token`
  non-blocking (remove the trailing `aclrtSynchronizeStream` +
  `aclrtMemcpy D2H`) and exposing a separate finish/event API so the
  host can queue all 15 CP groups' launches asynchronously. Both changes
  edit bodies that Track E is not allowed to touch. The host-level code
  in `talker.cpp` currently serializes: `sample → predict_code_groups
  (blocks host on every group's D2H) → compute_next_embedding →
  forward_decode`, and even with two independent streams at the engine
  level, CP's per-group host syncs leave no window for Talker[N+1]
  launch to overlap with CP[N]. Throughput on the canonical long
  utterance stays at 14.3 fps (matches pre-M6.1 baseline of 14.5 fps).
  **Decision**: M6.1 plumbing stays (zero-risk, enables future M6.3+
  work), M6.2 marked `[~]` with the fps shortfall recorded here. Full
  §8 note appended below.
- [ ] 6.3 Pipeline encoder + tokenizer encoder in prefill path (already
  parallel via threads; move to NPU streams).
- [ ] 6.4 Overlap codec decoder chunks with Talker/CP generation.
- [ ] 6.5 **Quality gate**: audio bit-identical to non-pipelined path.
- [ ] 6.6 **Throughput gate**: +10% wall-clock on end-to-end.

### Stretch — INT8 post-training quantization tuned for Ascend

- [ ] S1 Port-to-Ascend INT8 calibration using CANN's `aclnnQuantBatchMatmul`.
- [ ] S2 Accuracy recovery loop (if needed).
- [ ] S3 End-to-end validation.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- **Audio quality — ASR content check REQUIRED**: qwen3-asr on the
  generated wav must transcribe to within edit-distance 2 of the target
  text on each of the 5 canonical utterances. Run via
  `scripts/asr_quality_check.sh <dir> <targets.tsv>`. Adding DTW alongside
  is fine but DTW alone is NOT sufficient — a corrupted pipeline can
  match garbage-to-garbage at DTW 0.9+ while every utterance decodes to
  nonsense (this is exactly how M2.4 got marked `[x]` twice wrongly
  before the tokenizer_config.json bug was found).
- **Audio quality — user-ear pass**: on the same 5 utterances (English +
  Chinese + ICL + xvec + customvoice modes). ASR is necessary, not
  sufficient.
- **Throughput**: ≥ 25 fps end-to-end on Ascend 910B4 for a 10-word English
  utterance.
- **Memory**: peak NPU usage ≤ 16 GB (leaves half of 32 GB HBM free).
- **Correctness**: `test_cp_flow`, `test_talker`, `test_code_predictor` all
  pass. Integration smoke test from Rust harness passes.

### Verification stamp (per [x] item)

When marking any milestone item `[x]`, append a one-line
`**Verified-by:**` stamp citing (a) commit SHA, (b) the artifact that
proved it (wav path, log snippet, or test output), and (c) the gate
used (ASR / throughput / DTW / smoke). This forces reverting the stamp
when the artifact is invalidated by a downstream bug, instead of
carrying a silent false claim.

## 7. Risk register (live — append new rows)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| aclGraph capture hits NPU kernel bug (GatherV3 crashed ggml-cann path; our pure-aclnn engine doesn't use GatherV3) | Medium | Drops M4 win | Skip M4; extract what perf we can from M5+M6 alone |
| FRACTAL_NZ unsupported for some op | Medium | Partial M5 | Fall back to ND per-op |
| Native Talker precision drifts like CP did | Medium | Audio regression | Match ggml-cann's exact precision: F16 residual + F32 norm gamma + F16 FusedInferAttn. Use v14's precision scheme that matched well before hitting the hybrid wall |
| Talker f16 overflow (we know Qwen3 text encoder needs F32 per memory; TTS talker may too) | Low-med | NaN in output | F32 input projection already standard; fall back F32 end-to-end on specific layers if needed |
| Port of existing encoder/speaker impls is not trivial | Low | Adds 1-2 days | Keep llama.cpp-free path optional; build on existing C++ impls |

## 8. Decision log (live — append when deviating)

- **2026-04-17 Design**: Chose native-full over ggml-cann fork because AI
  portability removes the rewrite tax, eager NPU model doesn't map cleanly
  onto ggml's graph abstraction, and GGUF quantization advantage doesn't
  apply on CANN (no Q4/Q5 speedup).
- **2026-04-17 Scope**: qwen3-tts-core TalkerBackend contract unchanged;
  only the C++ compute behind qwen_tts_api rewrites. Minimizes Rust churn.
- **2026-04-17 Baseline**: user's ear-verified "clean" = llama.cpp CP path.
  MLX golden used for structural match (DTW) but audibly different due
  to different weight rounding path.
- **2026-04-18 (late) discipline update — three hard rules added after
  the tokenizer_config.json regression**:
  1. ASR content check is a required gate, not optional. DTW alone
     passed twice on garbage-to-garbage output.
  2. Every `[x]` must carry a `**Verified-by:**` stamp (commit + artifact
     + gate name). Invalidated artifacts must trigger a revert to `[~]`
     or `[ ]`.
  3. Tokenizer special-token load failures must be fatal, never a
     printf warning. Silent misconfig killed a day of M2 work.
  The regression root cause: `tokenizer_config.json` missing →
  `<|im_start|>` BPE'd as raw text → prefill role prefix corrupted →
  every utterance emitted "Oh." / "I'm sorry." / "Okay. Start. Start."
  across native AND llama paths. DTW on (garbage vs garbage) hit 0.9+,
  so the gate passed wrongly. Fix: commit 69c41884 makes it fatal.
- **2026-04-18 M1 landed**: native Talker 28-layer engine working end-to-
  end at the smoke level. All of M1.2-M1.6 passed. Key decisions /
  surprises:
  (a) Standalone binaries that don't link ggml-cann still need `aclInit(nullptr)`
  to load op tiling kernels — without it every aclnn op dies with
  "tiling_funcs NULL". `aclInit` was added to `cp_cann_symbols` and invoked
  idempotently from `cp_cann_load_symbols`. (CANN silently returns "already
  initialized" on the second call in binaries that ALSO link libggml-cann.so,
  so this is safe for the production `qwen_tts` exe too.)
  (b) Prefill uses FIAS built-in causality via `nextTokens=0, sparseMode=0`
  rather than a user-supplied mask. Tried `attenMask` (rejected — 910B only
  accepts BOOL/INT8/UINT8 masks) and `pseShift` (accepted but missing
  tiling-key for [1, n_heads, small_Sq, small_Skv] with stride-0 head
  broadcast on CANN 8.3). `nextTokens=0` works on every shape we tested
  and matches the semantics exactly.
  (c) `make_tensor` now computes `storage_len` as
  `max_offset + 1 = sum((shape[i]-1) * stride[i]) + 1` instead of
  `product(shape)` — required for any strided view into a larger buffer
  (KV cache slices, RoPE table slices). The older product-of-shape
  formulation worked accidentally in CpCannEngine because CP never took a
  non-contiguous view into a buffer whose storage exceeded the view size.
  (d) Deferred full byte-for-byte validation vs llama.cpp (would require
  linking the test to the llama.cpp compute path); smoke gates cover
  "engine runs correctly" and M2 will cover "audio quality matches".
- **2026-04-19 M4.1 landed, M4.2 blocked by workload shape (design
  note)**: the aclmdlRI* symbols and the per-pos graph cache are fully
  wired in `TalkerCannEngine::forward_decode`, captured graphs replay
  bit-identically, and the path crash-cleanly falls back to eager on
  any runtime failure. But the intended throughput win is not reachable
  for single-utterance workloads with this design, for two reasons that
  are both structural to the model rather than the implementation:
  (1) **No intra-utterance amortization**. The Talker decodes strictly
  left-to-right: for an N-token output we call `forward_decode(pos=p)`
  exactly once for each p in [prefill_len, prefill_len+N). Capture-once-
  then-replay can only amortize cost if the same `pos` is revisited in
  the same session, which never happens within one utterance. Capturing
  at each new `pos` pays 1× eager (pre-warm) + 1× capture overhead and
  returns 0× replay savings in the first (and, for single-shot
  `qwen_tts`, only) pass.
  (2) **CaptureBegin/CaptureEnd overhead is high on CANN 8.3**. Measured
  on the canonical long utterance ("Speech synthesis on neural processing
  units…", seed=42, cp_groups=8, 76 output frames), per-step Talker
  timing was 17 ms eager vs 67 ms with capture enabled — a ~50 ms tax per
  `forward_decode` call, which is nearly 3× the eager step cost.
  `ACL_MODEL_RI_CAPTURE_MODE_THREAD_LOCAL` was slightly less bad than
  `GLOBAL` (5.4 → 6.2 fps end-to-end) but still a net regression from
  14.5 fps eager.
  Decision: default OFF (`TALKER_CANN_GRAPH=1` opt-in), leave the
  infrastructure in place for the server-mode use-case (persistent
  engine across utterances can replay captured graphs from utterance 2
  onward and skip the per-step overhead), and mark M4.2 `[~]` with the
  throughput gate explicitly failed. The `[x]` cannot land until either
  (a) a benchmark harness exercises multi-utterance reuse, or (b) the
  capture-cost/replay-cost ratio improves (CANN 8.3 tuning work, or
  `aclmdlRICaptureTaskUpdateBegin/End` per-argument updates — which is
  M4.3+ territory). M5 (FRACTAL_NZ) and M6 (multi-stream) are the
  better near-term attacks on the 22+ fps target, since they apply to
  every decode step regardless of pos reuse.
  **Files touched (Track C only)**: `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}`
  (+27 lines; 4 optional symbols + `has_aclgraph()`), `tools/qwen_tts/
  talker_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` (+~200 lines; `run_decode_ops_` extraction,
  `decode_graphs_` cache, opt-in init, capture/replay flow, workspace-
  grow invalidation, destructor cleanup). No edits to `main.cpp`,
  `CMakeLists.txt`, or `forward_prefill`.
- **2026-04-19 Track E (M6.1 + attempted M6.2) — infrastructure landed,
  pipelining blocked by scope**: M6.1 (secondary stream on both engines
  + `set_stream`/`get_stream*` setters + event symbols in CannSyms) is
  now wired end-to-end. Build is clean, ASR passes 4/4 (utt1-utt3 plus
  the 32-word technical sentence), and fps holds at 14.3 fps on the
  long utterance (was 14.5 fps baseline; 0.2 fps delta is run-to-run
  jitter — eight-group CP at ~22 ms/step × 76 frames + Talker decode at
  ~17 ms/step + prefill + overhead — the plumbing is a no-op until a
  caller actually calls `set_stream()` to redirect an engine).
  **Why M6.2 (Talker[N+1] || CP[N]) does NOT land under Track E**:
  The structurally-required edits live in files Track E is explicitly
  not allowed to touch. The scope line says
  > `cp_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` — ONLY add `stream_b_`, `set_stream`,
  > `get_stream`. Do NOT edit `forward_one_token`.
  and the analogous rule for `talker_cann_engine.cpp`. With those
  constraints:
  (1) `CpCannEngine::forward_one_token` ends with an
      `aclrtSynchronizeStream` + host D2H memcpy. Every one of the 15
      per-group CP calls in `TalkerLLM::predict_code_groups` therefore
      blocks the host before the next call can even queue onto its
      stream — there is no window in which Talker[N+1] could launch on
      stream A while CP[N] keeps running on stream B.
  (2) Even if CP were made fire-and-forget, the provisional-embedding
      strategy from §5 M6.2 requires that, after CP[N] finishes, we add
      `delta = embed(cp_code[g]) - embed(pad_token)` into
      Talker[N+1]'s `input_stage_f32_dev_` *before* the Cast-F32-to-F16
      that is the first op inside `run_decode_ops_`. That insertion
      point is in the middle of `forward_decode`, which Track E cannot
      edit. Without that device-side add hook, the only correct option
      is to wait for CP[N] before preparing Talker[N+1]'s input (i.e.,
      straight serialization).
  Following the contract's explicit fallback clause ("If it does
  [break causality], fall back to straight serialization (no speedup
  but correct) and note in §8"), M6.2 stays at the current 14.3 fps
  and is marked `[~]`. The 22 fps throughput gate is NOT met by this
  track.
  **What the follow-up track needs to do** to hit 22+ fps:
  (a) Split `TalkerCannEngine::forward_decode` into `decode_launch(pos)`
      (queues all ops on `stream_`, no host sync) + `decode_fetch(pos,
      hidden_out)` (syncs stream, downloads F32). Ditto for CpCannEngine
      (`predict_group_launch(g)` / `predict_group_fetch(g, logits_out)`).
      This is body-edit territory — Track A-prime or a new Track F.
  (b) Add a device-side F32 add entry point to TalkerCannEngine so the
      provisional input can be patched on-device after CP fetch —
      `add_input_delta(float *delta_host)` that casts F32→F16 and adds
      into `cur_dev_` pre-run_decode_ops_. Body edit.
  (c) Wire an `aclrtEvent` fence: CP records on `stream_b_` after its
      last group; Talker's `decode_launch` for N+1 waits on that event
      (via `aclrtStreamWaitEvent`) before the host does its F32 delta
      add, so the NPU-level dependency is explicit rather than a host
      wall.
  With (a)+(b)+(c) + the M6.1 plumbing already in place, the predicted
  steady-state is ~25-30 fps (CP=22 ms and Talker=17 ms per step would
  overlap to ~22 ms/step = 45 fps idealized, minus the non-overlapping
  host work and the prefill amortization).
  **Files touched (Track E only)**: `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}`
  (+~18 lines; 5 event symbols), `tools/qwen_tts/talker_cann_engine.{h,cpp}`
  (+~25 lines in header, +~10 in cpp; `primary_stream_`, `stream_b_`,
  `set_stream/get_stream*`, dtor cleanup), `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_engine.{h,cpp}`
  (same shape as Talker). Zero edits to `forward_decode`, `forward_prefill`,
  `run_decode_ops_`, `forward_one_token`, `predict_code_groups`, or
  `TalkerLLM::generate`. The `stream_` field is now a runtime-swappable
  pointer to one of the two owned streams (primary default), which is
  the only required behavioral change to every call site that already
  reads `stream_` — none of those bodies had to change.
- **2026-04-18 Track D (M5.1 audit + M5.2 NZ plumbing) — infrastructure
  landed, call-site switch parked for M5.3**:
  **M5.1 audit** on Ascend 910B4 CANN 8.3.RC1 against
  `$ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME/include/aclnnop/`:
  - *WeightNz headers actually present*: `aclnn_quant_matmul_weight_nz.h`,
    `aclnn_grouped_matmul_weight_nz.h`,
    `aclnn_grouped_matmul_swiglu_quant_weight_nz.h`,
    `aclnn_grouped_matmul_finalize_routing{,_v2}_weight_nz.h`,
    `aclnn_mla_prolog_v2_weight_nz.h`.
  - *NOT present*: `aclnnMmWeightNz`, `aclnnMatmulWeightNz`,
    `aclnnBatchMatMulWeightNz`. The fp16 / fp32 plain matmul family
    does not expose a dedicated WeightNz entry point on CANN 8.3.
  - *Documented path*: `aclnn_trans_matmul_weight.h` exposes
    `aclnnTransMatmulWeight{,GetWorkspaceSize}` and
    `aclnnCalculateMatmulWeightSize{,V2}`. `aclnnTransMatmulWeight`
    refreshes the given weight tensor in-place ("经过此接口处理后此
    tensor被刷新为预处理后的matmul weightTensor格式根据亲和性进行
    ND或者私有格式的转换") so a subsequent `aclnnMm` / `aclnnMatMul`
    can pick up the private NZ layout transparently.
  - *Eligible call sites* (F16 2D weights):
    **CpCannEngine**: 7 projections per layer × 5 layers = 35 matmuls
    per token (`Mm` on `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj` at lines 878-880;
    `o_proj` at 1021; `gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj` at
    1037/1039/1043). NOT eligible: the F32 input projection at line
    824 (`aclnnTransMatmulWeight` doesn't support F32).
    **TalkerCannEngine**: same 7-projection pattern × 28 layers = 196
    matmuls per decode step. Decode call sites: lines 704/706/708
    (Q/K/V), 856 (O), 905/906/909 (gate/up/down). Prefill call sites
    (untouched by the M5.2 landing): lines 1228/1229/1230 (Q/K/V),
    1425 (O), 1484/1485/1488 (gate/up/down). Weight descriptors are
    rebuilt per call via `tensor_2d(lw.q_proj_w, ...)` etc, so the
    in-place descriptor refresh from `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` only
    has an effect if the REFRESHED metadata is the one read by
    `tensor_2d` at call time — i.e., the underlying weight buffer
    keeps its descriptor state between init and decode. The NZ pass
    is run once per buffer at init so all subsequent `tensor_2d`
    calls see the refreshed state.
    **CpCannEngine's BMM call sites** (`aclnnBatchMatMul` in the
    attention-on-NPU path) are NOT `aclnnMm` and are NOT covered by
    `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` — those operate on per-call Q/K/V
    tensors, not model weights, so the whole NZ discussion doesn't
    apply to them.
  **M5.2 implementation**: see §5 M5.2 stamp above. The key design
  decision is that the flag defaults OFF and the default build runs
  the exact pre-M5 path (verified by ASR-equivalent audio durations
  matching the M2.4/M3.4 baseline on utt1/utt2/utt3). The opt-in
  NZ-on path runs without init errors on Ascend, has_nz() returns
  true, and the per-layer `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` logs cleanly.
  **Surprise / M5.3 note**: the NZ-on smoke test showed that plain
  `aclnnMm` with an NZ-refreshed weight does NOT produce correct
  audio on CANN 8.3 (the 200-frame runs never naturally EOS — the
  model is consuming scrambled numerics). This contradicts the
  `aclnnTransMatmulWeight` header's "affinity-driven auto-detect"
  claim and means M5.3 (actually using `*WeightNz` op variants) is
  required for correctness, not just a performance nicety. For the
  fp16 matmul path there is no `aclnnMmWeightNz` on CANN 8.3, so
  M5.3 has two options: (a) wait for a future CANN release that
  exposes one; (b) call `aclnnMm` with the weight tensor's
  `aclFormat` explicitly set to `ACL_FORMAT_FRACTAL_NZ` (= 29) at
  descriptor-build time, instead of the default `ACL_FORMAT_ND` (=2),
  and let `aclnnMm` dispatch the NZ-aware kernel path. Option (b)
  needs experimentation to validate that the op dispatcher actually
  honors the format hint for Mm. The M5.3 agent should start there.
  **Files touched (Track D only)**: `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}`
  (+~24 lines; 2 optional symbols + `has_nz()`), `tools/qwen_tts/
  talker_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` (+~90 lines; setter/getter, env-var hook,
  `nz_convert_weight_` helper, per-layer hook after upload),
  `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` (+~70 lines; same shape,
  hooked into both `init` and `init_from_safetensors`). Zero edits to
  `forward_decode`, `forward_prefill`, `run_decode_ops_`,
  `forward_one_token`, any matmul call site, or `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **2026-04-19 Track A (M2.5 closed) — batched prefill restored as
  default**: the pre-M2.5 "cos-sim 0.28" bug had in fact been fixed
  between the M2.4 stamp (commit 948413b1, iterative default) and
  this ticket (by commit 2b0a2998's RoPE-unroll + FIAS-S_q=1 rewrite),
  but no one flipped the default back to the batched path. Verifying:
  rebuilt qwen_tts with the current source and `TALKER_PREFILL_BATCHED=1`
  produced cos-sim 0.9999+ against the iterative reference on real
  text embeddings, and ASR content-checks the same 3/3 (utt1 edit-
  distance-2, utt2/utt3 verbatim) as the iterative path.
  **Diagnostic surfaces added** (`tools/qwen_tts/`):
  (1) `test_mm_diff.cpp` — per-row `aclnnMm(W, X_col)` vs batched
     `aclnnMm(X, W^T_strided_view)` at real Talker dims (K=M=2048,
     N=127). Both produce bit-identical output (cos-sim 1.0),
     ruling out strided-weight matmul as a contributor.
  (2) `test_prefill_diff.cpp` — batched vs iterative `forward_prefill`
     on synthetic σ∈{0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0} gaussians over
     seq_len∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127} (all cos-sim ≥ 0.9996),
     PLUS an optional real-embedding-file mode (arg 2 = binary
     `[int32 seq_len][int32 hidden][seq_len*hidden f32]`) for
     end-to-end-equivalent cos-sim on production inputs. Real input
     at seq_len=127 = cos-sim 0.999999, cold-vs-warm identical.
  (3) `TALKER_PREFILL_INPUT_DUMP=<path>` env var in
     `TalkerCannEngine::forward_prefill` dumps the raw F32 input
     embeddings on the first call per process — feeds (2) above.
  **Default flip**: `forward_prefill` now runs the batched path
  unconditionally; `TALKER_PREFILL_ITERATIVE=1` forces the legacy
  iterative fallback for regression bisects. The old
  `TALKER_PREFILL_BATCHED` env var is no longer honored (its sole
  purpose was to opt into the then-buggy batched path).
  **Throughput delta**: main prefill on seq_len=127 is ~127 ms
  (default batched) vs ~2054 ms (iterative fallback), 16× speedup.
  End-to-end 209-frame natural-EOS run = 23.2 fps default vs
  ~16 fps iterative. M2.5 throughput gate (≥20 fps on ≥150-frame
  runs) now passes.
  **Files touched (Track A only)**: `tools/qwen_tts/talker_cann_engine.cpp`
  (env-var rename + diagnostic dump + comment update),
  `tools/qwen_tts/test_prefill_diff.cpp` (real-input mode + scale
  sweep), `tools/qwen_tts/test_mm_diff.cpp` (real-dim enlargement),
  `tools/qwen_tts/CMakeLists.txt` (two new test-target entries).

## 9. Parallelism playbook

When an agent is assigned a milestone item:

1. Agent reads §1-4 for context + §3 for current state.
2. Agent finds next `[ ]` in its assigned milestone.
3. Agent's deliverable must pass the milestone's quality gate before
   marking `[x]`.
4. Agent commits the milestone update with `[x]` and a one-line note under
   the item explaining what landed.
5. If agent blocks on a decision, agent appends to §8 Decision Log
   proposing the options; PM (this session) arbitrates.

Preferred parallel assignments:

- **After M3 lands**: spawn 3 agents — M4, M5, M6 in separate worktrees.
- **Within M1**: spawn 2 agents — 1.1+1.2 (weights/init) in one worktree,
  1.3 (decode) in another, reconverging for 1.4-1.7.

### Next round (as of the M3.1 release)

Three parallel tracks unblocked:

1. **Batched-prefill bug** (blocks full M2.5, highest ROI): localize why
   FIAS with S>1 produces cos-sim 0.28 vs the iterative-decode
   reference. Known-ruled-out: sparseMode=0/nextTokens=0 vs
   sparseMode=1/nextTokens=65535 (both wrong identically). Next
   suspects: Q/K batch strides, innerPrecise=2 on batch tensors,
   numKeyValueHeads broadcast with the strided KV-cache view.
2. **M3.2 + M3.3** (strip llama.cpp): safe to start in a worktree now
   that native is default. Put llama.cpp behind a `QWEN_TTS_LLAMA`
   CMake option, default OFF. `--llama_fallback` flag gated on the
   option.
3. **M4 aclGraph** (independent): add `aclmdlRI*` dlsym, wrap
   `forward_decode` capture/replay per pos. Must keep ASR content gate.

## 10. File index (for fast jumping)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` | Existing native CP engine (reference pattern for Talker port) |
| `tools/qwen_tts/cp_cann_symbols.{h,cpp}` | dlsym loader for aclnn symbols; add more symbols here |
| `tools/qwen_tts/talker_cann_engine.{h,cpp}` | **TO CREATE** — native Talker |
| `tools/qwen_tts/talker.cpp` | Orchestrator; integrate native path here |
| `tools/qwen_tts/qwen_tts_api.{h,cpp}` | C ABI surface — must stay stable |
| `tools/qwen_tts/main.cpp` | CLI flags — add `--native_talker` here |
| `tools/qwen_tts/CMakeLists.txt` | Build config — llama.cpp optional flag here |
| `/Users/yuechen/home/OminiX-MLX/qwen3-tts-core/src/backend.rs` | TalkerBackend trait spec — contract unchanged |
| `/Users/yuechen/home/OminiX-MLX/qwen3-tts-ggml/src/talker.rs` | Rust binding — should stay as-is |

## 11. Session boot checklist

When a new session picks up this contract:

1. `git status` in `/Users/yuechen/home/OminiX-Ascend` — confirm clean or
   note in-flight work.
2. Re-read §3 (current state) — verify no drift since last check.
3. Run the smoke bench to confirm current fps / audio are where docs claim:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/home/tensordock/KeyPair-4fbd-yue.pem -p 31984 \
     ma-user@dev-modelarts.cn-southwest-2.huaweicloud.com 'bash /tmp/bench_cp.sh'
   ```
4. Find next `[ ]` and start. Update `[x]` + decision log as you go.
