# Path C: AscendC Custom-Kernel Contract

Follow-on to `CP_FPS_OPTIMIZATION_CONTRACT.md`. W3b delivered only
+0.66 fps because `TASK_QUEUE_ENABLE=2` already amortizes per-dispatch
launch overhead — stock `aclnn` fusion can't close the remaining gap.
Path C authors custom AscendC kernels that **keep intermediate tensors
in on-chip SRAM** between multiple ops, eliminating DRAM round-trips
that stock `aclnn` always incurs.

**PM role**: supervise, gate, arbitrate. **PM does not write code.**
Every milestone below is an agent deliverable. PM signs off by
verifying the gate criteria (numbers, commit hash, ear-check).

## 1. Goal (single sentence)

Lift clean-quality xvec mayun zh fps from **30.5 fps** (current
committed, `clean-30.5fps-ear-verified` tag) to **≥ 33 fps** on ac01
via one or two custom AscendC kernels fusing CP-transformer
sublayers, **without regressing audio quality** (user-ear identical,
token drift ≤ 1 / frame / group).

## 1a. STATUS (2026-04-21 FINAL): CLOSED

**W4.1.3 wiring landed env-gated (fork `63a3d90e`). W4.1.4 drift gate
FAILED (max_drift=1949). PC-tile re-spike confirmed structural close.**

Agent PC-tile (2026-04-21) benchmarked a 40-AIV-core tiled F16 matmul
at M=1 CP decode shapes vs `aclnnMm`:

| Shape | aclnnMm | gemv-only (40 cores) | gemv + reduce |
|---|---|---|---|
| K=1024 N=3072 | 27 μs | **18.5 μs (-32%)** | 38 μs (+42%) |
| K=1024 N=2048 | 23 μs | 17 μs | 34 μs |
| K=3072 N=1024 | 26 μs | 34 μs | 47 μs |

**Gemv-only at 40 cores beats aclnnMm by ~26% in wall** (324 GB/s vs
222 GB/s HBM utilisation). BUT the mandatory cross-core F32→F16 reduce
kernel costs 18-22 μs — wipes the gemv win. Atomic-add is race-prone
at blockDim ≥ 20 and NaN-prone at blockDim=40 on 910B4 (hardware
limitation, not a kernel bug).

The ONLY way for Path C to win is to **fuse the reduce into a
downstream op** (next RmsNorm / Add / Mm). That fusion is exactly the
full attn-sublayer fusion W4.1 failed numerically. Re-authoring
correctly is estimated 2-3 weeks of expert AscendC work.

**PM decision**: Path C CLOSED. Artefacts preserved for reference:
- `~/pc_tile_probe/tiled_matmul.cpp` (207 LoC) on ac02
- `~/work/OminiX-Ascend-w1/tools/qwen_tts/ascendc/fused_attn_sublayer.cpp`
  on ac01 (W4.1.2v, paused)

If Path C is ever resumed, the spike proved multi-core tiling CAN beat
vendor at the gemv layer — the bottleneck is cross-op fusion, not
parallelism. Start any resumption by writing a fused RmsNorm + Mm (or
Mm + RmsNorm) spike and measuring whether the reduce folds in.

runtime divergence before any further wiring work.

## 2. Non-goals

- Not rewriting the full CP transformer in AscendC.
- Not touching Talker forward (separate track).
- Not the ICL Talker-KV gap (separate track).
- Not revisiting Path A/B (W3b closed that).
- Not MRoPE / xvec / customvoice logic changes.
- Not flipping any default — new code stays behind `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1`.

## 3. Current state (2026-04-21)

Committed: W1 (NPU lm_head) + W3b (`aclnnAddRmsNorm` fusion). Tag
`clean-30.5fps-ear-verified` on fork `ymote/OminiX-Ascend`.

**Per-frame CP cost** (mayun xvec zh, W1+W3b on, `TALKER_CP_PROF=1`):
- lm_head (NPU, via W1): ~2 ms
- CP `forward_one_token` (NPU, ×15): 18.3 ms each
- Total CP phase: ~20.3 ms → 30.5 fps wall

**Remaining dispatches per forward_one_token** (post-W3b): ~80 compute
ops. Attention sublayer = 12 ops; FFN sublayer = 7 ops.

## 4. Architecture target

**Two fusion targets**, each a candidate for one AscendC kernel:

**Kernel A — fused attention sublayer**. Collapses:
```
RmsNorm → [Q,K,V]-Mm(W8) → RoPE → FIAS → O-Mm → +residual
```
12 aclnn dispatches → 1 custom kernel. Q/K/V/attn intermediates stay in
SRAM (no DRAM). Expected savings: **~2 ms / forward_one_token** on the
W3b-post baseline.

**Kernel B — fused FFN sublayer**. Collapses:
```
RmsNorm → [gate,up]-Mm(W8) → SiLU → ⊙ → down-Mm → +residual
```
7 aclnn dispatches → 1 custom kernel. Expected savings: **~1.2 ms /
forward_one_token**.

Combined (both kernels): ~3.2 ms / forward_one_token × 15 groups =
48 ms / frame → theoretical ceiling ~40 fps. Realistic target with
kernel overhead: **33-35 fps**.

Env gate: `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1`. Both kernels opt-in; unset restores
bit-identical W1+W3b path.

## 5. Milestones

### W4.0 — Toolchain go/no-go (half day)

Single-track probe. **Agent C-probe**, ac01. If any sub-step fails,
STOP. Path C becomes a toolchain escalation, not an engineering track.

- [x] 4.0.1 Verify `ccec` AscendC compiler on ac01.
      **Verified-by**: ccec at `$ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME/compiler/ccec_compiler/bin/ccec`
      (bisheng 5c68a1cb1231 / clang 15.0.5). Not in default PATH —
      requires `source set_env.sh`. PASS.
- [x] 4.0.2 Verify custom-op / kernel launch API.
      **Verified-by**: contract's assumed `aclopRegisterCustom` API NOT
      present in CANN 8.3.RC1. Working path: `ascendc_library()` cmake
      macro at `$ASCEND_TOOLKIT_HOME/tools/tikcpp/ascendc_kernel_cmake/`
      auto-generates `aclrtlaunch_<kname>` host wrapper; runtime
      symbols in `libascendc_runtime.a` (`RegisterAscendBinary`,
      `LaunchAscendKernel`, `UnregisterAscendBinary`). Static-link,
      not dlsym. PASS.
- [x] 4.0.3 Hello-kernel round-trip.
      **Verified-by**: 4096 F16 elements, 1 block, identity copy
      kernel. Result: `kernel=0.564ms mismatch=0/4096` —
      bit-identical. Artifact: `~/work/OminiX-Ascend-w1/ascendc-probe/`
      on ac01 (`hello_kernel.cce`, `launch_kernel.cpp`, `cmake_ref/`).
- [x] 4.0.4 Template extraction.
      **Verified-by**: reusable snippets in the probe dir:
      `compile_ascendc.sh`, cmake fragment using `ascendc_library()`,
      `launch_kernel.cpp` 10-liner showing `aclrtlaunch_<kname>`
      pattern. Link line documented: `libascendc_runtime.a
      libascendcl libruntime libmsprofiler libmmpa libc_sec
      libprofapi liberror_manager`.

**W4.0 acceptance**: hello_kernel round-trip works on ac01; agent
reports the exact build + dispatch commands as a reusable snippet.
PM gates here — if infra isn't in place, no further Path C spend.

**Open issues for W4.0** — all resolved by C-probe on 2026-04-21:
1. ✅ Q1: Ad-hoc dispatch works. No pre-registered tiling fns required
   (tilingKey=0 path is supported).
2. ✅ Q2: `aclrtlaunch_<kname>(blockDim, stream, args...)` — the cmake
   kit generates this host wrapper automatically; it calls
   `LaunchAscendKernel` from `libascendc_runtime.a` internally.
3. ✅ Q3: **No re-layout needed.** AscendC kernels consume the
   engine's existing `aclrtMalloc`'d INT8 weight buffers directly via
   `__gm__ int8_t*`; scales are `__gm__ half*`. Kernel-internal
   dequant.

**CANN version note**: ac01 runs CANN 8.3.RC1 (not 8.5 as the
contract body assumed). All capabilities needed are present.

### W4.1 — Fused attention sublayer kernel (~2 weeks)

Single-track, ac01. **Agent C-attn**.

- [x] 4.1.1 **Kernel skeleton**: author `fused_attn_sublayer.ccec`
      implementing: one block of (RmsNorm → QKV-matmul → RoPE →
      attention → O-matmul → residual-add). F16 arithmetic. Weight
      layout matches `cp_cann_engine.cpp`'s existing Q/K/V/O uploads;
      **do not re-pack weights**, the engine's existing tensors are
      the input.
      **Verified-by**: skeleton at
      `tools/qwen_tts/ascendc/fused_attn_sublayer.cpp` (renamed from
      `.cce` because CANN 8.3.RC1's `ascendc_library()` only accepts
      `.cpp`/`.asc` — matches the probe's `kernel.cpp` convention).
      `ascendc_library()` + auto-generated
      `aclrtlaunch_fused_attn_sublayer` host stub build cleanly;
      `qwen_tts` target re-links with the new static lib. Tile
      strategy + KV-cache-append split documented in the file header.
      Scalar softmax's `exp` uses a Remez-quartic over `2^y` because
      `exp` is not exposed as an aicore intrinsic on 8.3.RC1.
- [x] 4.1.2 **Offline numerical validation**: extract one layer's
      input hidden + Q/K/V/O weights into test fixture. Dispatch the
      kernel on that fixture and compare output to the stock aclnn
      chain's output. Max-abs-diff ≤ 1e-2 (F16 noise). This step runs
      against canned input, not the live generate loop.
      **Verified-by (2026-04-21, W4.1.2v vector-primitive rewrite)**:
      fork commit `42efd0b` — `feat(tts): W4.1.2v vector-primitive
      rewrite of fused_attn_sublayer`. Scalar FMA loops that hung the
      NPU watchdog in the W4.1.1 skeleton replaced with AscendC vector
      primitives (Cast / Muls / Mul / Add / Duplicate / Exp / ReduceSum
      / DataCopy). EnQue/DeQue round-trips added on every GM↔UB
      boundary to sync MTE2/V/MTE3 pipes. `test_fused_attn_diff`
      harness also landed (was uncommitted after prior W4.1.1 spawn).
      Offline-diff result on the synthetic fixture (cp_hidden=1024,
      q_dim=2048, kv_dim=1024, head_dim=128, seq_len=8, host-F32 gold):
      ```
      [diff] residual max_abs_diff = 0.000488
      [diff] k_cache  max_abs_diff = 0.000488
      [diff] v_cache  max_abs_diff = 0.000977
      [diff] gate <= 1e-2; result: PASS
      ```
      **Note on push**: ac01 has no git push credentials configured
      for the fork remote (`https://github.com/ymote/OminiX-Ascend`).
      Both 4687768 (W4.1.1) and 42efd0b (W4.1.2v) are committed
      locally at `~/work/OminiX-Ascend-w1` on ac01 but not yet pushed.
      PM decision needed on push mechanism before W4.1.3 can reference
      the SHA externally.
- [x] 4.1.3 **Wire into `CpCannEngine`**: replace the attn-sublayer
      aclnn chain with `forward_lm_head`-style dispatch of the fused
      kernel, gated on `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1`. Unset = old path
      bit-identical. Skip dispatching both paths in parallel — gate is
      compile-time-like (runtime env, but path-exclusive).
      **Verified-by (2026-04-22, Agent C-attn-v3)**: ac01 local commit
      `be082ed` — `feat(tts): W4.1.3 wire fused attn kernel into
      CpCannEngine (env-gated)`. Build gate `QWEN_TTS_HAS_ASCENDC`
      (auto-on) + runtime gate `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1 AND w8_applied_`
      wire the W4.1.2v kernel at `forward_one_token_launch`'s per-layer
      attn sublayer; stock chain wrapped in `{}` and skipped via `goto
      ascendc_attn_done`. `init_ascendc_f16_gammas_` creates the F16
      q_norm/k_norm gammas the kernel reads (plus input_ln/post_ln/
      final_norm as insurance for ASCENDC-without-FUSION). Post-kernel
      `memcpy cur_dev_ ← residual_dev_` + `RmsNorm(cur, post_ln)`
      restores the buffer layout the stock FFN matmuls expect.
      Smoke (canonical mayun xvec zh, `--cp_greedy --seed 42
      --max_tokens 100`, env `TASK_QUEUE_ENABLE=2 TALKER_W8_QUANT=1
      TALKER_LM_HEAD_NPU=1 TALKER_CP_FUSION=1`):
      - `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1`: completes, 100 frames, wav produced
      - unset: completes, EOS at step 30, wav produced
      Both paths run without crash. Correctness drift (W4.1.4) and
      perf HARD KILL (W4.1.5) still pending. Patch at
      `/tmp/w4_1_3.patch` (ac01) → `/tmp/w4_1_3.patch` (Mac) ready for
      PM to push to fork.
- [x] 4.1.4 **Correctness gate** (live): canonical mayun xvec zh under
      `--cp_greedy --seed 42`. Token drift ≤ 1 / frame / group for
      first 16 frames (same gate as W1.4). If > 1, debug — do not
      ship. **Verified-by Agent C-attn-v4 (2026-04-21, ac01 @ be082ed)**:
      **FAIL, CATASTROPHIC**. max_drift=1949 codebook IDs at (frame 1,
      group 14); only 1/256 positions matched (frame 0 group 0 = 1995).
      Per-frame max drift: [1776, 1949, 1216, 1613, 1415, 1438, 1281,
      1753, 1163, 1848, 1902, 1786, 1515, 1538, 1305, 1620]. Both runs
      produced 16 frames and a wav; ASCENDC run was ~2.1× slower
      (4948 ms vs 2306 ms talker_xvec). Logs:
      `/tmp/w4_1_4_stock_tokens.txt`, `/tmp/w4_1_4_ascendc_tokens.txt`
      on ac01. Gate used existing `TALKER_CP_DUMP` plumbing (W1.4
      heritage). The fused ASCENDC attn kernel is mathematically
      incoherent, not just noisy — the hidden-state stream diverges
      from frame 0 onward. PM pivots to CannFusion per pre-arranged
      plan; W4.1.5 / W4.1.6 NOT run.
- [ ] 4.1.5 **Perf gate**: `TALKER_CP_PROF=1` shows fwd drops from
      18.3 ms → **≤ 16 ms / forward_one_token**. fps on canonical
      lifts from 30.5 → **≥ 32 fps**. If gate misses, STOP and report
      — PM decides to abandon Path C or adjust scope.
- [ ] 4.1.6 **User-ear gate**: deliver
      `/Users/yuechen/Downloads/tts_ab/w4a_final.wav` (attn-fusion ON)
      + `w4a_pre.wav` (off). PM ear-checks.

**Open issues for W4.1**:
1. What's the attn tile / pipeline strategy? AscendC samples show
   L1-resident Q-tiles × DRAM-streamed K/V/O; adopt that unless
   measurements say otherwise. Agent C-attn proposes in 4.1.1.
2. How does the fused kernel handle KV-cache append? Engine tracks
   `current_pos`; the kernel either takes (`pos`, existing-KV-pointer)
   and writes the new K/V slot itself, or engine appends externally
   and kernel reads the full KV. Pick one; document trade in 4.1.1.

### W4.2 — Fused FFN sublayer kernel (~1 week, gated on W4.1 passing)

Only proceeds if W4.1.5 cleared ≥ 32 fps. Same structure.

- [ ] 4.2.1 Kernel skeleton `fused_ffn_sublayer.ccec`
- [ ] 4.2.2 Offline numerical validation (≤ 1e-2)
- [ ] 4.2.3 Wire into CpCannEngine behind same `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1`
      gate
- [ ] 4.2.4 Correctness gate (live): ≤ 1 token drift / frame / group
- [ ] 4.2.5 Perf gate: cumulative fps ≥ **33 fps** xvec mayun canonical
- [ ] 4.2.6 User-ear gate: `w4b_final.wav` vs `w4b_pre.wav`

### W4.3 — (Optional) Cross-sublayer super-kernel (only if W4.1+W4.2 leave headroom)

If W4.2 lands cleanly and fps is at e.g. 33.5 (below 35), consider
one more spike fusing attn + FFN into a single super-kernel per
layer. PM decision point; not pre-funded.

## 6. Acceptance criteria (summary)

- [ ] W4.0 toolchain probe green
- [ ] W4.1 lands on fork with `TALKER_CP_ASCENDC=1` gate; xvec mayun zh
      ≥ 32 fps; token drift ≤ 1 / frame / group; user-ear clean
- [ ] W4.2 lands (if W4.1 passed); cumulative ≥ 33 fps; drift + ear
      clean
- [ ] Default off; unset gate = bit-identical to `clean-30.5fps-ear-verified`

## 7. Risk register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `ccec` missing or doesn't package as a reusable `.so` | High | W4.0.3 hello-kernel probe catches this in half a day. |
| Custom-op registration API not dlsym-accessible from existing `cp_cann_symbols.cpp` path | Medium | W4.0.2 records what IS available; agent picks the working API. |
| Weight re-layout needed (AscendC wants different INT8 layout than aclnn stores) | Medium | If yes, one-time re-pack at engine init (not per-frame). W4.1.1 documents layout; 4.1.2 validates against that layout. |
| Fused kernel slower than aclnn chain (bad tile strategy) | Medium | W4.1.5 perf gate is the kill criterion. PM aborts rather than iterate indefinitely. |
| F16 precision drift accumulates across kernel boundaries | Medium | 4.1.2 offline diff + 4.1.4 live drift + 4.1.6 ear gate all enforce; intermediate re-cast to F32 if needed. |
| AscendC kernel OOB / crashes on live NPU | Low | Develop behind env gate; never flip default; validate on short utts before long utts. |

## 8. Parallelism playbook

**Single-track, ac01 only.** The CP engine's source files
(`cp_cann_engine.cpp`, `cp_cann_symbols.cpp`) will be edited by both
W4.1 and W4.2 — running those in parallel would collide. Sequential
is the only safe path.

**Exception**: W4.2.1 (FFN kernel skeleton authoring) CAN overlap
with W4.1.6 (user-ear check on attn kernel), because those don't
touch the same files. Agent C-ffn can start sketching while PM is
running user-ear on attn. PM authorizes this overlap only once
W4.1.5 perf gate has passed.

**Host assignments**:
- ac01: all W4 milestones (kernel development + ac01 has the build
  tree + NPU for dispatch)
- ac02 / ac03: unused. Available for exploratory kernel
  micro-benchmarks if Agent C-attn wants a sandbox that doesn't
  touch the main build.

**Agent dispatch cadence (PM)**:
- One agent per milestone. 8 milestones total (0.1-0.4, 1.1-1.6, 2.1-2.6).
- Longer milestones (4.1.1 kernel authoring) may span multiple agent
  dispatches if the agent hits its session context limit; PM resumes
  or spawns a fresh agent with the prior agent's hand-off notes.

## 9. Sign-off

- [x] User signs this contract. **Signed 2026-04-21.**
- [x] PM dispatches Agent C-probe for W4.0.
- [ ] PM gates each milestone: verifies numbers + ear-check artifacts
      before authorizing the next milestone.
- [ ] PM pulls the plug at W4.1.5 if the perf gate doesn't clear.

---

**PM role reminder**: supervise, not implement. Every milestone is an
agent deliverable with a concrete quantitative gate. PM reads
reports, checks numbers, verifies ear, signs off, moves to next.

**Scope honest-sizing**: 3-4 weeks wall-time. Agent budget: ~8 agent
dispatches plus PM gate meetings between each.

**Current status**: draft, pending user sign-off. No code spawned.
